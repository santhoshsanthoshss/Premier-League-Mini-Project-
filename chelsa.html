            <h3>Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli has today joined Chelsea <br/> Football Club.</h3>
             <p>Bettinelli arrives having been out of contract at Fulham, and he will add strength to our goalkeeping resources following the departure of Willy Caballero.

                The 6ft 4in keeper spent over a decade at Craven Cottage, making 120 appearances for the Whites, and also represented the England Under-21 team earlier in his career.
                
                On signing a two-year contract at Stamford Bridge, Bettinelli said: 'It’s always been a special club. I know the area very well so it’s been a dream of mine to come over to this side and it’s finally happened. There were some talks a few years ago when I was a bit younger and for whatever reason that didn’t come about but I’m here now.</p>

                <p>Chelsea Football Club are an English professional football club based in Fulham, West London.

Chelsea are among England's most successful clubs, having won over thirty competitive honours, including six league titles and eight European trophies. Their home ground is Stamford Bridge.

                    Chelsea won their first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. The club won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970 and their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971. After a period of decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup competitions. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history: they have won five Premier League titles, two UEFA Champions League titles and two UEFA Europa League titles during this period. Chelsea are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, the first English club to achieve the UEFA treble, the only London club to have won the Champions League and the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice.
                    
                    Chelsea's home kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. The club's crest features a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff.The club has rivalries with neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a historic rivalry with Leeds United. Based on attendance figures, the club has the sixth-largest fanbase in England. In terms of club value, Chelsea are the sixth most valuable football club in the world, worth £2.13 billion ($2.576 billion), and are the eighth highest-earning football club in the world, with earnings of over €428 million in the 2017–18 season.
